# Initial Project State Creation - 2025-08-22

## Overview
Initial creation of the machine-readable project state file (`project_state.yaml`) to provide structured context for AI assistants and development tooling.

## Changes Made
- **Added**: `meta` section with schema version, timestamps, and state tracking
- **Added**: `overview` section documenting architecture, patterns, and constraints  
- **Added**: `capabilities` section defining telegram webhook and health check endpoints
- **Added**: `models` section documenting the Config data structure
- **Added**: `symbols` section mapping key code entry points
- **Added**: `delta` section for tracking state evolution over time

## Purpose
This project state file serves as a self-updating, machine-first context file that:
- Provides AI assistants with structured project understanding
- Documents capabilities and interfaces for automation
- Tracks project evolution through delta logging
- Maintains referential integrity through symbol mapping

## Context
Project: Telegram voice-to-text bot using Kotlin/Ktor framework
Stage: Early development phase with basic infrastructure in place
Next: Implementation of core voice processing and user management features
